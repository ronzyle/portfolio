    <p>My name is Ronnie Kung'u and welcome to my first official website. Here id like to talk a little bit about myself.i was born a little bit over 20 years ago and as i was growing up i developed an interest for technology which led me to take a course on electrical engineering,which i dropped after one year of schooling realizing it wasn't the path i wanted to follow. During my time of self-discovery i came to realize how rapidly new electronic computing machines are popping from every corner of this planet.</p>
    <p>Aside from my quest for coding knowledge i do enjoy a few other things as well;</p>
