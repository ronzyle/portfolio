    <p class="align">My name is Ronnie Kung'u and welcome to my first official website. Here id like to talk a little bit about myself.i was born a little bit over 20 years ago and as i was growing up i developed an interest for technology which led me to take a course on electrical engineering,which i dropped after one year of schooling realizing it wasn't the path i wanted to follow. During my time of self-discovery i came to realize how rapidly new electronic computing machines are popping from <em>every</em> corner of this planet.</p>
    <p>I felt this burning desire to interact with all of them and what better way to do so than learning their language. With this i realized if i can "speak" their language, that i could basically make machines accomplish desired tasks of my choosing. So i embarked on a journey, a quest of some sort, to search for the best school that could teach me how to create programmes. This brought me to moringa school's door step and i can say, as i write this article, that this is the best choice i made for my career.</p>
    <p>Aside from my quest for coding knowledge i do enjoy a few other things as well;</p>
    <div class="list">
     <ul>
      <li>playing basketball</li>
      <li>swimming</li>
      <li>traveling</li>
     </ul>
      </div>
